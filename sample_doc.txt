Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. 
AI systems can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as 
visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from 
experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms 
that can access data and learn from it.

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple 
layers. These networks can learn complex patterns in large amounts of data. Deep 
learning has achieved remarkable results in image recognition, natural language 
processing, and game playing.

Neural Networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They 
consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Each connection has 
a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, 
interpret, and generate human language. NLP combines computational linguistics with 
machine learning and deep learning models.
